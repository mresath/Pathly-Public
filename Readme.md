# Pathly-Public

- [App Store]() (Not out yet)
- [Google PlayStore]() (Not out yet)

**Pathly** is a habit/lifestyle app I designed in my freetime mainly to address my own incapability of staying consistent. While it shines with its gamification features, such as the ability to view your own stats, it has everything an app of its kind should have, and then more. The app is free and I intend on it staying that way, and even if monetization becomes necessary to keep it running it will be through in-app purchases for the RPG feature currently in development.

The app's [privacy policy](PrivacyPolicy.md) and [terms & conditions](Terms.md) will always be up-to-date on this repository, also (hopefully) with the latest andorid build.

If you encounter any bugs don't hesitate to create an issue here, or get in contact through [this mail](mailto:pathly.life@gmail.com).
