## Description

Do you struggle with discipline, consistency, timeliness, or simply can't get stuff done? You have come to the right place! With Pathly, you can get your life back in track, and have fun doing so.

### FEATURES

#### CUSTOM ACTIVITIES

Create activities for whatever you want to log or track, and customize them to your liking: icons, difficulty, how they affect you.

#### HABITS & TASKS

Create habits with advanced recurrence patterns for your daily needs, and tasks for your long-term goals and deadlines. Link them to your activities and customize them further if needed. Set reminders to never forget them again, and turn on neglection if you want an extra motivator.

#### TRACKING

See your streaks and past performance, analyze your journey, reflect and improve.

#### GAMIFICATION

View your own stats and watch them change based on what you choose to do. Negative activities and neglecting habits or tasks will cause your stats to deteriorate, while each one you successfully complete leads to marginal improvements. With the in-app RPG, put those stats to test and compete with and against other users.


#### COMMUNITY

Participate in the app's community: create a profile, make friends, form parties, build accountability, improve together.


#### FREE TO USE

All of the features listed above are completely free! If you enjoy the app, consider purchasing in-game currency to support its development. In-game currency is only used in the RPG and has no impact on the rest of your progress.

## More Info

**Pathly** is a habit/lifestyle app I designed in my freetime mainly to address my own incapability of staying consistent. While it shines with its gamification features, such as the ability to view your own stats, it has everything an app of its kind should have, and then more. The app is free and I intend on it staying that way, and even if monetization becomes necessary to keep it running it will be through in-app purchases for the RPG feature.

The app's [privacy policy](PrivacyPolicy.md) and [terms & conditions](Terms.md) will always be up-to-date on this repository, also (hopefully) with the latest andorid build.

If you encounter any bugs don't hesitate to create an issue here, or get in contact through [this mail](mailto:pathly.life@gmail.com).
